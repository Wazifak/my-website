    <p>
      In a world, where competition is rising every single day, one question that troubles everyone is:
      <em>"How do I truly know my strength and talents?"</em>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      The answer lies in something every one of us carries on our fingertips - our fingerprints.
      Yes, our fingerprints are not just patterns; they are the map to your brain that helps us know our hidden potential.
      This is exactly what DMIT is all about - a powerful, scientific way that helps us understand our inborn potential.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">üî¨ What exactly is DMIT?</h2>
    <p>
      DMIT stands for <strong>Dermatoglyphics Multiple Intelligence Test</strong>.
      It is based on dermatoglyphics - the scientific study of fingerprints.
      DMIT is a tool that helps you discover your inborn talents, learning style & intelligence type.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4 font-semibold">Here's why it works:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
      <li>Your fingerprints and brain are developed at the same time (13th-19th week of pregnancy).</li>
      <li>They remain unchanged throughout life.</li>
      <li>They carry deep connections with your brain structure and development.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-4">
      DMIT is like a mirror to your brain and personality. It tells you who you really are,
      what you're naturally good at and how you can achieve success in the easiest and most natural way.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">üß† The Science Behind DMIT</h2>
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mt-2">
      <li><strong>Neuroscience</strong> Brain development and its link to fingerprints</li>
      <li><strong>Psychology</strong> Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligence</li>
      <li><strong>Genetics</strong> DNA-based uniqueness that influences natural abilities</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">üîç Fingerprints & Brain Connection</h2>
    <p class="mt-2">
      Research shows that fingerprints and brain development share the same genetic code. Thus, analysing fingerprints gives a clear understanding of:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
      <li>IQ (Intelligence Quotient)</li>
      <li>EQ (Emotional Quotient)</li>
      <li>AQ (Adversity Quotient)</li>
      <li>CQ (Creativity Quotient)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-2">
      This means DMIT doesn't just tell you what you are good at  it shows you how to grow in the real world.
